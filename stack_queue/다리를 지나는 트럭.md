### 내 풀이

```python
import collections


def solution(bridge_length, weight, truck_weights):
    answer = 0
    total = 0
    passing = collections.deque([0]*bridge_length)
    waiting = collections.deque(truck_weights)
    while total != sum(truck_weights):
        answer += 1
        total += passing.popleft()
        if waiting:
            t = waiting.popleft()
            if sum(passing) + t <= weight:
                passing.append(t)
                continue
            waiting.appendleft(t)
            passing.append(0)
    return answer
```
